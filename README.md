# Evolution Simulation
### Simple "evolution" simulation that I made while bored

### This is not supposed to be rigorous, the mutation mechanic is completely random, I have no clue what the objective was, and I just kept adding randomg mechanics.

### I've tried it with multiple setups, and it can optimize for scarce environments, or optimize for speed, or so on. It's not really useful, I made this for fun
